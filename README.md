# Goulash

An interoperability proxy and test suite for heterogeneous
programming models and compilers.

The goulash project will contain a set of proxy codes that test
compiler and linker interoperability features that are needed to
build complex applications with multiple libraries that are written
in a variety of languages and programming models.  Tests will be
assembled from published fundamental algorithms, basic numerical
methods, and the tools and scripts needed to launch the suite and
verify results.  Tests may include material from previously released
proxy apps but will not include full applications or libraries.
