rush_larsen_gpu_omp_fort

This is a single file Fortran 2003 test mechanically generated from rush_larsen/Generator/rush_larsen_fort_template.F90.   It will be overwritten if rush_larsen/Generator/generate_source is run.   The fortran was hand generated in an attempt to replicate the C++ functionality and results.

This test is designed to allow direct performance comparisons between naively written HIP/CUDA and OpenMP GPU offloading schemes in a variety of coding styles and languages of a * parameterized embarrassingly parallel Rush Larsen kernel. Also allows testing build systems (including SPACK) handling of complicated build situations that LLNL cares about.
  
Designed to create ~20 single file test variants where no -D options required to select the variant and no include files are needed.  Almost all code in this file is identical between variants (this is intentional).  MPI support is ifdefed out for non-MPI variants.

The naming convention of the variant copies is intended to indicate variant abilities:  
 _cpu_serial      - single threaded, no OpenMP, on CPU  
 _cpu_omp         - use OpenMP to spawn threads on CPU  
 _gpu_omp         - uses OpenMP to offload to GPU  
 _gpu_hip         - uses HIP to offload to AMD or Nvidia GPU  
 _gpu_lambda_hip  - RAJA-like lambda HIP variant  
 _gpu_cuda        - uses CUDA to offload to Nvidia GPU  
 _gpu_lambda_cuda - RAJA-like lambda CUDA variant  
 *_mpi            - uses and exercises MPI e.g. _gpu_omp_mpi  
 *_fort           - Fortran version e.g. _gpu_omp_mpi_fort  

A mechanically generated makefile in the directory supports 'make' 'make check' and 'make clean'.  Use or modify the makedef files in rush_larsen/Generator with rush_larsen/Generator/generate_source to recreate these makefiles to target your system and compilers.

Example build (from LLNL's RZNEVADA on 7/21/21):

make  
/usr/tce/packages/cray-mpich-tce/cray-mpich-8.1.7-cce-12.0.1/bin/mpicrayftn  '-DCOMPILERID="cce-12.0.1"'  -O3 -g -fopenmp -haccel=amd_gfx908 rush_larsen_gpu_omp_mpi_fort.F90   -o rush_larsen_gpu_omp_mpi_fort

Here is a sample usage info from the above variant (run executable with -h or no arguments):
